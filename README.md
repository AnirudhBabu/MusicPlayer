# Music Player
A simple and elegant Music Player built using the Windows Forms Framework in .NET. The app is capable of:
  1. Playing music from a local file (supported types - mp3, wav), fast-forwarding
  2. Creating and deleting playlists
  3. AutoPlay for Playlists
  4. Tab view for switching between Playlists
It makes use of JSON serialization and deserialization for data persistence (playlists and related data).
